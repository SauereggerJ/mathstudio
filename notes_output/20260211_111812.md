**Theorem:** A subset of $\mathbb{R}$ is connected if and only if it is an interval.

**Proof:**

"\(\Rightarrow\)": Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ be connected. Since $X$ has at least two elements, set $a := \inf(X) \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$ and $b := \sup(X) \in \overline{\mathbb{R}}$, and $(a, b)$ is not empty and $X \subseteq [a, b] \cup \{a, b\}$.

We show now that $(a, b) \subseteq X$. Suppose to the contrary that $(a, b) \not\subseteq X$. Then there is some $c \in (a, b)$ with $c \notin X$.

Let $O_1 := X \cap (-\infty, c)$ and $O_2 := X \cap (c, \infty)$. Then $O_1$ and $O_2$ are open in $X$. Off course $O_1 \cup O_2 = X$ and $O_1 \cap O_2 = \emptyset$.

By our choice of $a, b$ and $c$, there are elements of $X$: $x, y$ with $x < c$ and $y > c$. This means that $x \in O_1$ and $y \in O_2$, and so $O_1$ and $O_2$ are nonempty. Hence $X$ is not connected, contradicting the hypothesis.

Since we have shown $(a, b) \subseteq X$ and we know $X \subseteq [a, b] \cup \{a, b\}$, we have shown $X$ is an interval.

"\(\Leftarrow\)": Suppose to the contrary that $X$ is an interval and there are open nonempty subsets $O_1$ and $O_2$ of $X$ with $O_1 \cap O_2 = \emptyset$ and $O_1 \cup O_2 = X$.

Choose $x \in O_1$ and $y \in O_2$ and suppose $x < y$. Define $z := \sup(O_1 \cap [x, y])$.

The element $z$ cannot be in $O_1$ because $O_1$ is open in $X$ and $X$ is an interval, and so there is some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $[z, z+\varepsilon) \subseteq O_1 \cap [x, y]$. This contradicts the supremum property of $z$. Similarly, $z$ cannot be in $O_2$, since otherwise there is some $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $(z-\varepsilon, z] \subseteq O_2 \cap [x, y]$, which contradicts $O_1 \cap O_2 = \emptyset$ and the definition of $z$. Thus $z \notin O_1 \cup O_2 = X$.

On the other hand, $[x, y] \subseteq X$ is contained in $X$ because $X$ is an interval. Since $x \in O_1$ and $y \in O_2$, we have $z = \sup(O_1 \cap [x, y]) \in [x, y] \subseteq X$.

This leads to the contradiction $z \in [x, y] \subseteq X$ and $z \notin X$. $\square$
