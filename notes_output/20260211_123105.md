# Continuity 1

**Definition:**
Let $f\colon X \to Y$ be a function between metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$. Then $f$ is continuous at $x_0 \in X$ if for each neighborhood $V$ of $f(x_0)$ in $Y$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ in $X$ such that $f(U) \subseteq V$.

The function $f\colon X \to Y$ is continuous if it is continuous at each point of $X$.

**Proposition: $(\varepsilon, \delta)$**
A function $f\colon X \to Y$ is continuous at $x_0 \in X$ if and only if for each $\varepsilon > 0$, there is some $\delta := \delta(x_0, \varepsilon) > 0$ with the property that
$$
d(f(x), f(x_0)) < \varepsilon \quad \forall x \in X \colon d(x_0, x) < \delta \quad (*)$$

# Proof

*   Let $f$ be $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-continuous and $\varepsilon > 0$.
    By the definition of continuity, $B_Y(f(x_0), \varepsilon)$ is a neighborhood of $f(x_0)$, then there exist a $U$ of $x_0$ with $f(U) \subseteq B_Y(f(x_0), \varepsilon)$, but for this $U$ exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $B_X(x_0, \delta) \subset U$ so we have
    $$f(B_X(x_0, \delta)) \subseteq f(U) \subseteq B_Y(f(x_0), \varepsilon)$$
    which translates to the statement $(*)$.

*   Now suppose $(*)$ is true, and $V \in \mathcal{N}(f(x_0))$. Choose a $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $B_Y(f(x_0), \varepsilon) \subset V$, then with $(*)$ we have $U := B_X(x_0, \delta)$ with
    $$f(U) \subseteq B_Y(f(x_0), \varepsilon) \subset V$$
