### 1) Prove that $-(-v) = v$ for every $v \in V$.

With $1.32$: $(-1)v = -v$

$$-(-v) = (-1)(-v) = (-1)((-1)v) = (-1)(-1)v = 1v = v$$ 

### 2) Suppose $\alpha \in F$, $v \in V$, and $\alpha v = 0$. Prove that $\alpha = 0$ or $v = 0$.

If $\alpha \neq 0$, then there exists $\alpha^{-1}$ with $\alpha \alpha^{-1} = 1$,

$$
\alpha^{-1}(\alpha v) = \alpha^{-1} \cdot 0
$$

Since $\alpha^{-1}(\alpha v) = (\alpha^{-1}\alpha) v = 1v = v$, and $\alpha^{-1} \cdot 0 = 0$ (by a related axiom):

$$
v = 0
$$

If $v \neq 0$, then $\alpha$ has to be zero, otherwise it will contradict the previous part.

### 3) Suppose $v, w \in V$. Explain why there exists a unique $x \in V$ such that $v + 3x = w$.

1) For $(w-v) \cdot \frac{1}{3} = x$ the statement is true (assuming $\frac{1}{3}$ exists in $F$ because $3 \neq 0$ in $F$ if $F$ is a field, and since $V$ is a vector space, the required element exists by closure properties if $3$ is invertible, which it must be for $\frac{1}{3}$ to be meaningful in this context, or perhaps this is just assuming the structure is a vector space over a field where $3 \neq 0$ allows division by 3).

2) If $x'$ is an other element of $V$ with $x' \neq (w-v) \cdot \frac{1}{3}$ and

$$
v + 3x' = w : \quad v + 3x' = v + 3x$$

By cancellation property (or subtracting $v$):

$$
3x' = 3x
$$

Assuming cancellation holds for scalar multiplication (which relies on the field axioms, specifically cancellation law for multiplication):

$$
x' = x$$

So it's because of the cancellation property:
$$a=b \iff a+x = b+x, \text{ and}$$ 
$$a=b \iff x \cdot a = x \cdot b \text{ for } x \in F \text{ and } x \neq 0$$

### 4) The empty set is no vector space because of:

The zero vector must exist.

$$
\exists x \in V : v+x=x \text{ for all } v \in V.
$$
(This implies the existence of the zero vector, which the empty set lacks.)
