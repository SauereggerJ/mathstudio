# Connectedness

**Definition.**: If $X$ is a topological space, a separation of $X$ is a pair of nonempty, disjoint open subsets $U, V \subset X$ such that $U \cup V = X$.

$X$ is disconnected if there exists a separation of $X$, and connected otherwise.

# Examples:

1. $X$ is the union of the two disjoint closed disks $\overline{B_{1}(2,0)}$ and $\overline{B_{1}(-2,0)}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Each of the disks is open in $X$, so the pair of disks is a separation of $X$.

2. $Y = \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$, the two sets $(-\infty, 0)$ and $(0, \infty)$ separate $Y$.
   ($(-\infty, 0)$ is short for $\{x \in Y \mid x < 0\}$.)

3. $Z = $ the set of points with rational coordinates. A separation is given by $U = \{(x,y) \mid x < \pi\}$ and $V = \{(x,y) \mid x > \pi\}$.
