# Isomorphic Vector Spaces

**Definition:** An isomorphism is an invertible linear map.

* Two vector spaces are called isomorphic if there is an isomorphism from one vector space onto the other one.

***

**Theorem:** Two finite-dimensional vector spaces over a field $\mathbb{F}$ are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension.

***

**Proof:**

1. First suppose $V$ and $W$ are isomorphic finite-dimensional vector spaces, and $T$ the isomorphism.
    * Because $T$ is invertible, we have $\text{null}(T) = \{0\}$ and $\text{range}(T) = W$. Thus $\dim(\text{null } T) = 0$ and $\dim(\text{range } T) = \dim W$.
    * Thus $\dim V = \dim(\text{null } T) + \dim(\text{range } T) = 0 + \dim W = \dim W$.

2. Suppose $V$ and $W$ are vector spaces with $\dim(V) = \dim(W) = n$. Let $\{v_1, \dots, v_n\}$ be a basis of $V$ and $\{w_1, \dots, w_n\}$ be a basis of $W$.

3. Define $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$ by:

$$
T(c_1 v_1 + \dots + c_n v_n) = c_1 w_1 + \dots + c_n w_n$$

4. Thus, $T$ is a well-defined isomorphism between $V$ and $W$.
