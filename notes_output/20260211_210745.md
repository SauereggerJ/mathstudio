**Theorem:** Let $V$ be finite dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. The zeros of the minimal polynomial of $T$ are the eigenvalues of $T$.

**Proof:** Assume $p(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$ and $\lambda$ is a zero of this polynomial. 
Then we find $p(x) = (x - \lambda) \cdot q(x)$ and $p(T) = (T - \lambda I) \cdot q(T) = 0$. Because $q(T)$ is of degree smaller than $p(T)$, there must exist a $v \in V$ with $q(T)v \ne 0$. This means $(T - \lambda I)(q(T)v) = 0$ and this shows $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$.
For the other direction assume that $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$, therefore $Tv = \lambda v$ for $\alpha v \ne 0$. By successive guesses we get $T^k v = \lambda^k v$. Thus $p(T)v = p(\lambda)v$. Because $p$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$ we get $p(\lambda)v = 0$ but this means $p(\lambda) = 0$, which identifies $\lambda$ as a zero of $p$.

**Proposition:** Suppose $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $q \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$. Then $q(T) = 0$ if and only if $q$ is a polynomial multiple of the minimal polynomial $p$ of $T$.

**Proof:** First suppose $q(T) = 0$, then by polynomial division algorithm there are polynomials $s$ and $r$ such that $q = p \cdot s + r$, with $\text{degree}(r) < \text{degree}(p)$. We have $q(T) = p(T)s(T) + r(T) = r(T)$, but this implies $r(T) = 0$ and because $p(T)$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$, $r$ must be of degree $0$ or $r = 0$. This leads to the equation $q(T) = p(T) \cdot s(T)$ which is what we want to show.
If $q(T)$ is a polynomial multiple of $p(T)$ then we have $q(T) = s(T) \cdot p(T) = s(T) \cdot 0 = 0$ as desired. \hfill $\square$

**Corollary:** Suppose $V$ is finite dimensional, $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$, and $U$ is a subspace of $V$ that is invariant under $T$. Then the minimal polynomial of $T|_{U}$ is a polynomial multiple of the minimal polynomial of $T$.

**Proof:** Let $\rho$ the minimal polynomial of $T|_U$ on $U$. Then $\rho(T|_U) = 0$ and therefore $\rho = s \cdot p$ with $s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$.

**Theorem:** Suppose $V$ is finite dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Then $T$ is not invertible if and only if the constant term of the polynomial of $T$ is $0$.

**Proof:** Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\rho$ is the minimal polynomial of $T$. Then $T$ is not invertible $\iff 0$ is no eigenvalue of $T \iff 0$ is no zero of $\rho \iff$ the constant term of $\rho$ is $0$.
