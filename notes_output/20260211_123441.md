**Theorem:** A continuous function $f$ defined on an interval $[a, b]$ takes on absolute minimum and absolute maximum values.

For some $x_0, x_1 \in [a, b]$ and for all $x \in [a, b]$ we have
$$
f(x_0) \leq f(x) \leq f(x_1)$$

**Proof:**

* $M = \text{least upper bound from } f(t) \text{ as } t \text{ varies in } [a, b]$
$$
M = \sup\{f(x) : x \in [a, b]\}$$
This $M$ exists, because $M$ is bounded and not empty.

* Consider the set $X = \{x \in [a, b] : \sup V_x < M\}$, with
$$V_x = \{y \in \mathbb{R} : \text{ for some } t \in [a, x] \text{ we have } y = f(t)\}$$
    * $-V_x$ is the set of all images of $f$ from $a$ until $x$.
    * $-X$ is the set of all points in $[a, b]$; such that all elements from $a$ to $x$ have images under $f$ that are smaller than $M$, more so even $\sup V_x < M$.

* Case 1: $f(a) = M$. Then $f$ takes on a maximum at $a$ and the theorem is proved.

* Case 2: $f(a) < M$. Then $a \in X$ and therefore $X \neq \emptyset$ and because $X$ is bounded by $b$, $X$ has a least upper bound.
Define $c = \sup X$.

If $f(c) < M$, we choose $\varepsilon > 0$ with $\varepsilon < M - f(c)$.
By continuity at $c$, there exist a $\delta > 0$ such that
$$|t - c| < \delta \implies |f(t) - f(c)| < \varepsilon$$
Thus $\sup V_c < M$.
If $c < b$ this implies there exist points $t$ to the right of $c$ at which $\sup V_t < M$, contrary to the fact that $c$ is the $\sup$ of such points.
Therefore $c = b$, which implies that $M < M$, a contradiction.
So $f(c)$ is not less than $M$, and so $f(c) = M$, and $f$ assumes its maximum at $c$.
