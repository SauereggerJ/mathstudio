## Proposition
Let $\mathcal{B}$ be a basis in a set $X$, and let $\mathcal{T}$ be the collection of all unions of $\mathcal{B}$. Then $\mathcal{T}$ is a topology on $X$.

### For the proof we first observe

**Remark:**
Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of $X$. Then the collection $\mathcal{T}$ defined in the proposition is precisely the set of all subsets of $X$ that satisfy:

* For every $x \in \mathcal{T}$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subset \mathcal{T}$.

## Basis criterion with respect to $\mathcal{B}$

Given $X$ and a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $X$, we say that a subset $U \subset X$ satisfies the basis criterion with respect to $\mathcal{B}$ if, for every $x \in U$, there exists $B \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $x \in B \subset U$.

## Lemma:
Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is a basis of $X$. Then the collection $\mathcal{T}$ defined in the proposition is precisely the set of all subsets of $X$ that satisfy the basis criterion with respect to $\mathcal{B}$.
