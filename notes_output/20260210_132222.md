**Theorem:** In a finite-dimensional vector space, the length of every linearly independent list of vectors is less than or equal to the length of every spanning list of vectors. (A, page 35)

**Theorem:** Every subspace of a finite-dimensional vector space is finite-dimensional. (A, page 36)

## Bases and Dimension

**Definition:** A basis is a list of vectors in $V$ that is linearly independent and spans $V$.

**Theorem:** A list $v_1, \dots, v_n$ of vectors is a basis of $V$ if and only if every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form

$$V = a_1 v_1 + \dots + a_n v_n, \quad a_1, \dots, a_n \in F$$
(A, page 39)

**Theorem:** Every spanning list in a vector space can be reduced to a basis of the vector space. (A, page 40)

**Theorem:** Every finite-dimensional vector space has a basis. (A, page 41)

**Theorem:** Every linearly independent list of vectors in a finite-dimensional vector space can be extended to a basis of the vector space. (A, page 41)

**Theorem:** Suppose $V$ is finite dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Then there is a subspace $W$ of $V$ such that $V = U \oplus W$.
