### 13. Union of Three Subspaces

Prove that the union of three subspaces $A, B, C$ of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if one of the subspaces contains the other two.

*   **($\Longleftarrow$):** Easy: $A \cup B \cup C = A$ if $B \subseteq A$ and $C \subseteq A$, and $A$ is a subspace.
*   **($\Longrightarrow$):** If $A \cup B \cup C$ is a subspace and there exists $x \in A$ but $x \notin B$ or $x \in A$ but $x \notin C$:


### 12. Union of Two Subspaces

Prove that the union of two subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other.

**Proof:**

1.  $0$ has to be in $A$ and $B$, because both are subsets.
2.  $a \in A \cup B$ implies $a \in A$ or $a \in B$.

*   **($\Longrightarrow$):** If none of the both is contained in the other then there exist two elements with the following conditions:
    $$a \in A \text{ and } a \notin B, \quad b \in B \text{ and } b \notin A.$$ 
    Because $A \cup B$ is a subspace: $a+b$ must be $\in A \cup B$
    $$\text{so } a+b \in A \text{ or } a+b \in B;$$ 
    but if $a+b \in A$ and $a \in A$ and so $-a \in A$:
    $$b = (a+b) + (-a) \text{ also must be element of } A. \\$$ 
    The same argument holds for $a+b \in B$, therefore.
    $A$ must be contained in $B$, or $B$ must be contained in $A$.

*   **($\Longleftarrow$):** If $A \subseteq B$ or $B \subseteq A$ then $A \cup B = A$ or $A \cup B = B$. ...
