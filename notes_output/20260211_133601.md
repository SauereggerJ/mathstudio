## 24.10. Axler

**Lemma**: Suppose that $P, s \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$, with $s \neq 0$. Then there exist unique polynomials $q, r \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$ such that:
$$
P = sq + r$$
and $\deg r < \deg s$.

Proof: Let $n = \deg p$ and $m = \deg s$. If $m > n$, take $q=0$ and $r=p$.

Thus assume $n \geq m$.
The list $\{1, z, \dots, z^{m-1}\}$ is linearly independent in $\mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F})$, also the list $\{1, z, \dots, z^n\}$ is a basis of $\mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F})$. Hence, it is a basis of $\mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F})$. Because $p \in \mathcal{P}_n(\mathbb{F})$ there exist unique constants $a_0, \dots, a_n \in \mathbb{F}$ such that
$$p = a_0 + a_1 z + \dots + a_{m-1} z^{m-1} + b_0 s + b_1 z s + \dots + b_{n-m} z^{n-m} s$$
where $b_i \in \mathbb{F}$.

We assert that $p = sq + r$ with $\deg r < \deg s$.

The uniqueness of $q, r \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{F})$ follows from the uniqueness of the constants $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{m-1} \in \mathbb{F}$ and $b_0, b_1, \dots, b_{n-m} \in \mathbb{F}$.

**Theorem?**: Every nonconstant polynomial with complex coefficients has a zero in $\mathbb{C}$.
