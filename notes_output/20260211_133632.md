# 1.1 M. Axler: Dual Space and Dual Map

**Definition:**
A linear functional on $V$ is a linear map from $V$ to $F$.
In other words, a linear functional is an element of $\mathcal{L}(V, F)$.

**Definition:**
The dual space of $V$, denoted by $V^\prime$, is the vector space of all linear functionals on $V$.
In other words, $V^\prime = \mathcal{L}(V, F)$.

**Lemma:**

Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then $V^\prime$ is also finite-dimensional and

$$\dim V^\prime = \dim V.$$

**Proof:**

$$\dim V^\prime = \dim \mathcal{L}(V, F) = (\dim V) \cdot (\dim F) = \dim V.$$
