## 5. Vector Space Axiom Replacement

Show that in the definition of a vector space, the additive inverse condition can be replaced with the condition that: $0v = 0$ for all $v \in V$.

With $0v = 0$ for all $v \in V$ follows:

$$(1-1)v = 0$$
$$v + (-1)v = 0 \quad \text{and therefore for}$$ 
$$w := (-1)v \quad \text{with} \quad v+w = 0 \quad \text{for all } v \in V \text{ exists.}$$ 

## 6. Extended Real Line Operations

Let $\infty$ and $-\infty$ denote the two distinct objects, neither of which is in $\mathbb{R}$. Define an addition and multiplication on $\mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty, -\infty\}$ as you could guess from the notation:

$$
\mathbf{0} = \begin{cases} -\infty : & t < 0 \\ 0 : & t = 0 \\ \infty : & t > 0 \end{cases} \quad \quad t \cdot (-\infty) = \begin{cases} \infty : & t < 0 \\ 0 : & t = 0 \\ -\infty : & t > 0 \end{cases}
$$

$$
t + \infty = \infty + t = \infty
$$
$$
t + (-\infty) = (-\infty) + t = (-\infty) + (-\infty) = -\infty
$$
$$
\infty + (-\infty) = (-\infty) + \infty = 0
$$

$$
\infty + (\infty - \infty) = \infty \quad (\infty + \infty) - \infty = 0
$$

So this addition is not associative.

## 7. Function Spaces as Vector Spaces

Suppose $S$ is a nonempty set. Let $V^S$ denote the set of functions from $S$ to $V$. Define a natural addition and scalar multiplication on $V^S$ and show that $V^S$ is a vector space with these definitions:

$$f, g \in V^S : f: S \to V, \quad g: S \to V$$
$$(f+g)(x) := f(x) + g(x) \quad \quad (\lambda f)(x) := \lambda f(x)$$
