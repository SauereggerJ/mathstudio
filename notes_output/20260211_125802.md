## Accumulation Points of a Set in $(M,d)$

**Def.:** A point $x \in M$ is an accumulation point of $A \subset M$ if every open set $U$ containing $x$ contains some point of $A$ which is not $x$.

Or: $\forall \varepsilon > 0, (B_{\varepsilon}(x) \setminus \{x\}) \cap A \neq \emptyset$.

**Examples:** All accumulation points of $\{\left(x, \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right) : x > 0\} \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ are $A \cup \{(0,y) : -1 \le y \le 1\}$.

**Lemma:** A set is closed $\iff$ the accumulation points of $A$ are in $A$. Or there are no accumulation points of $A$ in $A^c$.

**Proof:** 
$A$ closed $\iff A^c$ open $\iff \forall x \in A^c \exists \varepsilon > 0 : B_{\varepsilon}(x) \subset A^c$
$$\iff \forall x \in A^c \exists \varepsilon > 0 : B_{\varepsilon}(x) \cap A = \emptyset$$
$$\iff x$ is no accumulation point. $\square$

## The Closure of a Set in $(M,d)$

**Def.:** The closure of $A$ (denoted $\mathrm{cl}(A)$ or $\overline{A}$) is the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$.

**Lemma:** $\bullet \mathrm{cl}(A)$ is closed $\bullet A \subseteq \mathrm{cl}(A) \bullet A = \mathrm{cl}(A) \iff A$ is closed.

**Proof:** A intersection of closed sets is closed. Every set in the intersection contains $A$, therefore $A$ is in the intersection. If $A$ is closed $A$ is in the intersection, so $A$ is the intersection.

**Example:** 
$$\mathrm{cl}\left(\{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subset \mathbb{R}\right) = \left\{\frac{1}{n} : n \in \mathbb{N}\right\} \cup \{0\}$$

**Lemma:** Given $A \subset M$, let $L$ be the set of all accumulation points of $A$. The closure of $A$ is:
$$\mathrm{cl}(A) = A \cup L. \quad (\iff \mathrm{cl}(A)^c = A^c \cap L^c)$$
