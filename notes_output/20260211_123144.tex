\textbf{Proposition:} A function $f: X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if for every open set $O \subseteq Y$, the preimage $f^{-1}(O)$ is open in $X$.

\textbf{Proof:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \ensuremath{\Rightarrow} Let us assume $f: X \to Y$ is continuous and $O \subseteq Y$ is open in $Y$. To show that $f^{-1}(O)$ is open, we have to show: $\forall x \in f^{-1}(O) \exists U_x \text{ open in } X \text{ such that } U_x \subseteq f^{-1}(O)$.
    First, if $f^{-1}(O) = \emptyset$, nothing is left to show because $\emptyset$ is open in $X$.
    Let's take $x \in f^{-1}(O)$. Then there exists at least one $y \in O$ with $f(x) = y$. Because $O$ is open, $O$ is a neighborhood of $y$. Because $f$ is continuous, there exists a $\tilde{U}_x$ neighborhood with $f(\tilde{U}_x) \subseteq O$, because of the definition of neighborhood $\tilde{U}_x$ contains an open $U_x$ with $U_x \subseteq \tilde{U}_x$, and so $f(U_x) \subseteq O$, but because of this every $\hat{x} \in U_x$ is also an element of $f^{-1}(O)$, and therefore $U_x \subseteq f^{-1}(O)$.
    \item \ensuremath{\Leftarrow} Now suppose $\tilde{O}$ is a neighborhood of an element $y$ in $Y$, then there exists an open set $O$ in $Y$ with $O \subseteq \tilde{O}$ and $y \in O$. We want to show the preimage of this open set $f^{-1}(O)$ is open and it contains $x$ with $f(x) = y$ if $y \in f(X)$, because $f^{-1}(O)$ is open it is a neighborhood of $x$ and $f(f^{-1}(O)) \subseteq O \subseteq \tilde{O}$. Therefore $f$ is continuous.
    (The second part is somehow quirky, it should start with $x \in X$ and then take $\tilde{O}$ from $Y$ with $f(x) \in \tilde{O}$, then all works the same way, and we show that $f$ is continuous in $X$ for all $x \in X$).
