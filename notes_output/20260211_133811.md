## Definition: Dual Basis

Def.: If $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_n$ is a basis of $V$, then the dual basis of $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_n$ is the list $\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n$ of elements of $V'$, where each $\varphi_j$ is the linear functional on $V$ such that

$$\varphi_j(\mathbf{v}_k) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } k=j \\ 0 & \text{if } k \neq j \end{cases}$$

## Lemma 1: Representing Vectors via Dual Basis

Lemma: Suppose $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_n$ is a basis of $V$ and $\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n$ is the dual basis. Then, for each $\mathbf{v} \in V$, we have

$$\mathbf{v} = \varphi_1(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + \varphi_n(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{v}_n$$

Proof: Suppose $\mathbf{v} \in V$. We write $\mathbf{v} = c_1\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + c_n\mathbf{v}_n$.

Applying $\varphi_j$ yields:
$$\varphi_j(\mathbf{v}) = c_j$$

Thus, $\mathbf{v} = \varphi_1(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{v}_1 + \dots + \varphi_n(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{v}_n$.

## Lemma 2: Dual of a Basis is a Basis

Lemma: Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then the dual of a basis of $V$ is a basis of $V'$. Let $\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n$ denote the dual basis.

Proof: Suppose $\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_n$ is a basis of $V$. Let $\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n$ denote the dual basis.

First, we show that $\varphi_1,\dots,\varphi_n$ are linearly independent (as linear maps).
Suppose $a_1\varphi_1 + \dots + a_n\varphi_n = 0$ (zero linear map).

Then, for each $\mathbf{v}_k$:
$$(a_1\varphi_1 + \dots + a_n\varphi_n)(\mathbf{v}_k) = a_k$$
Since the resulting linear map is zero, we have $a_k = 0$ for each $k$.

Because the length of the dual basis is $n$, this linearly independent list must be a basis.
