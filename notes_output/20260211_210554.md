# Column-Row Factorization

Suppose $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix with entries in a field $F$ and column rank $c \ge 1$.
Then there exist an $m \times c$ matrix $C$ and a $c \times n$ matrix $R$, both with entries in $F$, such that $A = CR$.

**Proof:**

The list $A_{:,1}, A_{:,2}, \ldots, A_{:,n}$ of columns of $A$ can be reduced thus to a basis of the span of the columns of $A$.
This basis has the length $c$.
The $c$ columns in this basis can be put together to form an $m \times c$ matrix $C$.
If $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, then column $k$ of $A$ is a linear combination of the columns of $C$. Make the coefficients of this linear combination the $k$-th column of a $c \times n$ matrix that we call $R$. Then $A = CR$.

Suppose $A \in F^{m \times n}$. Then the column rank of $A$ equals the row rank of $A$.

**Proof:**
Let $c$ denote the column rank of $A$. Let $A = CR$ be the column-row factorization of $A$.
Then every row of $A$ is then a linear combination of the rows of $R$. Because $R$ has $c$ rows, this implies that the row rank of $A$ is less or equal to the column rank $c$ of $A$.

To prove the inequality in the other direction, apply the result in the previous paragraph to $A^T$, getting:

$$\text{column rank of } A = \text{row rank of } A^T$$
$$\le \text{column rank of } A^T$$
$$\le \text{row rank of } A.$$

Thus the column rank of $A$ equals the row rank of $A$.
