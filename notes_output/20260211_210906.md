19) Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space. $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$
$$T \text{ injective } \iff \exists S \in \mathcal{L}(W, V): ST = \text{id}_V$$

**Proof:**

$\implies$ because $T$ is injective: $\dim V = \dim \text{range}(T) \le \dim W$, so $V$ is finite dimensional too.

Choose a basis of $V$: $B_V = \{v_1, \dots, v_n \}$. Because $T$ is injective,
$T(v_1), \dots, T(v_n)$ are linearly independent, and we can extend
that list to a basis of $W$: $\{T(v_1), \dots, T(v_n), w_1, \dots, w_m \}$.

Define $S \in \mathcal{L}(W, V)$:
$$S(T(v_i)) = v_i, \quad \dots, \quad S(T(v_n)) = v_n, \quad S(w_1) = 0$$
$$\dots \quad S(w_m) = 0$$

$S$ is linear and unique.

For $v \in V$:

$$ST(v) = ST\left( a_1v_1 + \dots + a_nv_n \right) =$$ 
$$S\left( a_1T(v_1) + \dots + a_nT(v_n) \right) =$$ 
$$a_1ST(v_1) + \dots + a_nST(v_n) = a_1v_1 + \dots + a_nv_n = v$$

$\Longleftarrow$ If $T(v_1) = T(v_2)$ then $ST(v_1) = ST(v_2)$ and with the
assumption given $v_1 = v_2$. $\square$
