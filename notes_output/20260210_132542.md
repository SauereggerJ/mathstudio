**Banach space and Hilbert Space**

*   A sequence $(x_n)$ in $X$ is called a Cauchy sequence if, for each $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $d(x_n, x_m) < \varepsilon$ for all $m, n \geq N$.
*   A metric space $X$ is called complete if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges.
*   A complete normed vector space is called Banach space.
*   A complete inner product space is called a Hilbert space.

**Notes:**

*   Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence.
*   Every Cauchy sequence is bounded.
*   If a Cauchy sequence has a convergent subsequence, then it is itself convergent.
*   $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{C}^m$ are Banach spaces.
*   Let $X$ be a nonempty set and $E = (E, || \cdot ||)$ a Banach space. Then $B(X, E)$ is also a Banach space.
