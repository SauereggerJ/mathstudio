# Series 4

**Theorem (Ratio Test):** Let $\sum x_k$ be a series in $E$ and $K_0$ be such that $x_k \neq 0$ for all $k \geq K_0$. The the following hold:

1. If there are $q \in (0, 1)$ and $K \geq K_0$ such that $\left|\frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k}\right| \leq q$ for all $k \geq K$, then the series $\sum x_k$ converges absolutely.
2. If there is some $K \geq K_0$ such that $\left|\frac{x_{k+1}}{x_k}\right| \geq 1$ for all $k \geq K$, then the series $\sum x_k$ diverges.

**Proof:** 
1. $|x_{k+1}| \leq q |x_k|$ for all $k \geq K$. Therefore: $|x_k| \leq q^{k-K} |x_K| = \frac{|x_K|}{q^K} q^k$, for $k \geq K$. Set $c := |x_K|/q^K$. Then $c \sum q^k$ is a convergent majorant for the series $\sum |x_k|$, and $\sum x_k$ converges absolutely absolutely.
2. $|x_{k+1}| \geq |x_k|$ implies that $x_k$ is no null sequence, and so $\sum x_k$ diverges. $\square$

## Rearrangement of Series:

**Def.:** Let $\sigma: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ be a permutation. Then the series $\sum_k x_{\sigma(k)}$ is called a rearrangement of $\sum_k x_k$.

**Theorem (Rearrangement Theorem):** Every rearrangement of an absolutely absolutely series $\sum x_k$ is absolutely convergent and has the same value as $\sum x_k$.

**Proof:** For each $\varepsilon > 0$, there is by Cauchy criterion a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\sum_{k=N+1}^m |x_k| < \varepsilon$ for all $m > N$.
Taking the limit $m \to \infty$: $\sum_{k=N+1}^\infty |x_k| \leq \varepsilon$.

Let $\sigma$ be a permutation of $\mathbb{N}$. For $M := \max \{\sigma^{-1}(0), \dots, \sigma^{-1}(N)\}$, we have
$$\left|\sum_{k=0}^m x_{\sigma(k)} - \sum_{k=0}^N x_k\right| \leq \sum_{k=N+1}^m |x_k| \leq \varepsilon$$
$\{\sigma(0), \dots, \sigma(M)\} \supseteq \{0, \dots, N\}$, this means we choose $M$ so large that all indices up to $N$ are in the images up to $M$. Thus, for each $m \geq N$, 

$$
\left|\sum_{k=0}^m x_{\sigma(k)} - \sum_{k=0}^N x_k\right| \leq \sum_{k=N+1}^m |x_k| \leq \varepsilon \quad \text{and also} \quad \left|\sum_{k=0}^m x_{\sigma(k)} - \sum_{k=0}^N x_k\right| \leq \varepsilon
$$
