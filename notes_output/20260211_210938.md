20. Suppose $W$ is finite dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V, W)$. Prove that $T$ is surjective if and only if there exists $S \in \mathcal{L}(W, V)$ such that $TS$ is the identity operation on $W$.

**Proof:**

$\Rightarrow$ ($T$ is surjective): $\text{range}(T) = W$

Let $B_W = \{w_1, \dots, w_n\}$ be a basis of $W$. Then because $\text{range}(T) = W$, for every $w_i \in B_W$ there exists a $v_i \in V$ with $T(v_i) = w_i$.

Define $S$:
$$S w_i = v_i$$
$S$ is in $\mathcal{L}(W, V)$ and with this definition

$$TS(w) = T(a_1 S(w_1) + \dots + a_n S(w_n))$$
$$= a_1 T S(w_1) + \dots + a_n T S(w_n)$$
$$= a_1 w_1 + \dots + a_n w_n =$$

Therefore $TS(w) = \text{id}_W$

$\Leftarrow$ ($S$ exists\dots):

$$w = T(S w), \text{ but this implies } v = S w : T(v) = w \text{ and}$$ 
therefore $\text{range}(T) = W$

$\square$
